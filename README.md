An online poker game for distributed systems course

## Application Suitability
* ❌ Compose a list of reasons why your idea is relevant and why its implementation through distributed systems is
necessary. 
* ❌ Provide real-world examples of well-known projects (such as Facebook) that are similar
and employ microservices.

## Service Boundaries
* ❌ Each microservice should encapsulate specific functionality, such as user authentication, product
catalog, or order processing, to ensure modularity and independence.
* ❌ Create simple system architecture diagram.

## Technology Stack 
* ❌ When implementing microservices, you must carefully choose the technology stack for each service. This includes decisions on programming languages, frameworks.

## Communication Patterns
* ❌ You might use RESTful APIs (synchronous communication) or message queues (asynchronous
communication) to enable inter-service communication.

## Data Management
* ❌ Consider how data will be managed across microservices, as you can opt for separate databases for each service, use APIs for data access and so on.
* ❌ Enumerate all the endpoints across all your services and define the
data to be transferred, including its format and type (you may present it in JSON format, Protobuf
format, or any preferred format, with clarity being utmost importance). 
* ❌ Define the response returned by each endpoint.

## Deployment and Scaling
* ❌ Determine how you’ll deploy and scale your microservices. 
* ❌ Consider containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for managing
deployment and scaling
